      <h2>Who we are?</h2>
      <p>
        Ipek Yadegar Ilyad as a startup software company was founded on 21 December 2020. The main purpose of the
        founders was to establish a knowledge-based institute to offer software solutions for industrial needs. Our
        focus is on oil, gas, and petrochemical industry but we will welcome related projects from other industries.
        A usual problem with current software solutions for industrial companies is the generality of them. Most
        software applications are developed for commercial purposes and to meet the requirements of all types of
        companies regardless of their special processes. No matter if the company is industrial or non-industrial. Most
        software developers don’t care if their customers are producing goods or services. This might be due to lack of
        qualified experts in software producing companies who are competent in industrial processes. As a results when
        an industrial company purchases a software product, it must adapt its working processes with the capabilities of
        that software application. This may lead to rejection of the application by users and employees, imposing a huge
        burden of cost to the purchaser. To avoid this problem, it is required to analyze the very special requirements
        of any organization and develop the software exactly based on the business needs of that organization.
        To address this issue, the knowledge based Ipek Yadegar Ilyad company was founded by a team of people with both
        academic background and oil industry experienced experts. Being aware of the differences between business
        processes of various factories, their organizational culture and technical literature, we are ready to design,
        implement and make operational our tailor-made software solutions for your business needs.
