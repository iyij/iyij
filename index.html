        IYI Company was established in 2019 with the aim of creating a knowledge-based
        institution,
        in order to provide software solutions for industrial needs.
        The main focus of this institute is on the oil, gas and petrochemical industries,
        but it is also considering cooperation proposals from other industries.
        One of the important problems of many applied software designed in the country is that they are public.
        These products have been prepared for commercial purposes and for all companies and institutions,
        whether industrial, non-industrial, manufacturing or non-manufacturing.
        Due to the lack of mastery of the analysts of the computer companies on the industrial processes,
        the needs of different industries are not clearly known to the software designers.
        The result of the implementation of such software systems is that instead of their vendors adapting
        their product to the user's needs,
        organizations must change their work processes to match the new software.
        As a result, due to the unfamiliarity of the environment of the new application system,
        the users of these systems give up on these systems after a while and return to their traditional tools.
        Therefore, a heavy cost in terms of money and time is imposed on organizations. In order to avoid this
        problem,
        software analysis should be done exactly based on the needs and current processes of the organizations.
        For this purpose, the knowledge-based company IYI Jamadar Iliad Jam has been formed with the
        cooperation of a team consisting of industry and university experts. Knowing the different needs of each
        organization from other organizations or industries, organizational culture and technical literature,
        this company is ready to accept the design and installation of the best software systems ordered by the
        customer.
