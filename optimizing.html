      <h2>Optimizing the amount of manufactured products</h2>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>Profit and loss of any production plant depends on production parameters. The most important incoming
          parameters are the amount of feed, utilities like electricity, steam and fuel and outgoing parameters such as
          the quantity of products. Meanwhile the costs of product overhead, export and logistic have an important
          effect on the profit margin of the plant. It is also required to consider the commitment of the plant to
          product certain amount of a product or receive a specific amount of feed regardless of its effect on the
          overall profit. It is obvious that considering all these factors and taking their trade-off into account is a
          complex issue. Solving these multi variable problem and finding the optimized mix of products requires having
          a deep knowledge of the product processes and industrial accounting. Based on this complex situation, sale
          engineers must suggest a product plan for next month to the operation section to maximize the net profit.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The decisions to decide on the quantity of feed and products could be taken more effectively by utilizing a
        software system that help with the computation of all these variables and prediction of all scenarios. If you
        are looking for a complete solution on management of the basket of products, Product Planning System software is
        made for you. This is a decision support software which helps make the most important business objective of the
        plants come true: maximizing the profit.</p>
      <p>Using this software solution, sale engineers can take the essential decisions of the enterprise more
        confidently and accurately minimizing the risks of wrong decisions. According to practical cases implementing
        the suggested decisions of this software system has increased the profit of the plants between 5 to 30 percent.
        More importantly it prevents sale engineers from taking wrong decisions which may lead to loss. So, having such
        a crucial software system is a must-have for any production complex. </p>
      <p>The IYI Co. has developed a fully web-based software system to address these issues.</p>
      <h3>IYI Production Planning Software</h3>
      <p>The Production Planning Software, PPS, is an administrative software solution to maximize the final benefit of
        the plant. To achieve its objectives, PPS answers these questions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>- Which products should be produced for next production period?</li>
        <li>- How much the break-even price of products should be?</li>
        <li>- What mixture of production and sales of goods would maximize net profit?</li>
        <li>- Receiving feeds from which source(s) would maximize the profit? The software finds the answer considering
          the different quality of feeds of the refineries.</li>
        <li>- Which processing units should be stopped from production and which one should be in service?</li>
        <li>- Which process unit should produce goods with its maximum capacity or higher?</li>
        <li>- What would be the effect of different decisions on company’s profit or loss?</li>
        <li>- Production and sales of which one of the intermediate products or blended products would result in higher
          profits?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>All these questions are answered when you have the required data for different production scenarios. Having the
        price prediction of feeds and products, currency exchange rate, plant overall costs and available prices in the
        Platts magazine the software suggest you the best scenarios.</p>
      <p>Final profit or loss of the complex for upcoming production period will be predicted with respect to different
        production and sales situations. So, according to the market status, the conditions of feeds and processing
        units, the managers can take the best decisions to maximize the profit of the complex.</p>
      <p>Other outputs of the software are analyzed of the basket of products, profit or loss of sales, revenue of sale,
        the cost of feeds, the prime cost of production, profit and loss of different scenarios, feeds analyses, all
        financial parameters of the complex, tons-dollar values of different possible decisions, break-even prices and
        various managerial charts and graphical reports. By means of managerial reports that is table-based reports that
        contains a variety of information on production, sales, price, and cost.</p>
      <h4>Technical Specification</h4>
      <p>All of tools and structures used in the software including data base, integrated development environment,
        programming languages and so are open source. So, no license is needed. The software runs with minimum hardware
        resources. It is web-based. Python and JavaScript are used at the backend, HTML and CSS are used at the frontend
        part of the system. It enjoys the PostgreSQL as its database engine.</p>
